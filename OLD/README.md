The OLD folder contains various notebooks that acted as a sandbox to help me develop the final code found in the src folder and the notebooks in the parent folder.

I haven't made any attempt to tidy up the code inside or name the notebooks better, but I'm leaving them here in case any of this old code might be useful in future.

(Technically all this would be present in previous git versions even if I deleted it, but I figure it's easier just to leave it here for people to find rather than search through the different vsersions.)
